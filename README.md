# NLP
This is a natural language processing project I made very quickly during a weekend.

It is a sentiment and topic analysis of tweets.

I started with preliminary text cleaning and processing. This inlucded removing duplicates, puncuations, numbers, stopwords and some other things.

Then I did a feature extraction. This included n-grams, bag of words, IDF, sentiment analysis, and topic modelling.
